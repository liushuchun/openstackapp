OpenStack Vsm is distributed under the terms of the Apache
License, Version 2.0. The full terms and conditions of this

Vsm primarily consists of a set of Python daemons, though
it requires and integrates with a number of native system
components for databases, messaging and virtualization
capabilities.

follow `@openstack <http://twitter.com/openstack>`_ on Twitter.

To learn how to deploy OpenStack Vsm, consult the documentation
available online at:

In the unfortunate event that bugs are discovered, they should
be reported to the appropriate bug tracker. If you obtained
the software from a 3rd party operating system vendor, it is
often wise to use their own bug tracker for reporting problems.
In all other cases use the master OpenStack bug tracker,
available at:

always base their work on the latest Vsm code, available from

Developers should also join the discussion on the mailing list,
at:

   https://lists.launchpad.net/openstack/

Any new code must follow the development guidelines detailed
in the HACKING.rst file, and pass all unit tests. Further
